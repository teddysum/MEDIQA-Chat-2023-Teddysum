CHIEF EXAM: the patient is a new patient to the clinic. She was referred in early october for chest pain and swallowing problems due to a referral from the emergency department of the hospital of the er of a referral of a gastroesophageal reflux disease (GER) and esophageseal disease (ES-2 ) to the hospital in early 2020. The pain was right behind her breastbone. She tolerated it for four days but then had to go to the emergency room because nothing i did relieved it. They did a bunch of testing and didn't find anything.
Doctors discussed the possibility of an egd, but she hasn't had any more episodes since then.
The other option is just to continue and monitor, uh, for any additional symptoms at which point we could do the eGD.

REVIEW OF the patient's Vitals

Vitals are normal at ninety ninety seven. 2
 respiratory rate is normal at like twenty.2
Heart rate is also elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute, but that's not anything crazy but something to mention that your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not that crazy but we do wan na give it you said that it's gon na happen in a couple of weeks

Patient reports that she injured her wrist yesterday morning. She slipped and she put her arms out to catch herself and then all of a sudden i just my wrist started to hurt real bad and it got real swollen

 The patient reported that she had her back hit her basket and for some reason this cold started to kinda fall out and she was trying to catch it i missed a step and i just totally

The patient states that she has a ace wrap at home and then she put ice on it and then tried and move it sideways does radial deviation hurt.
The pain is not severe, but it's just not it's really bad when i move it all, and it hurts more or is it just best to keep it like down

Reports that she is going on vacation, but she needs to cancel it because she is not going a vacation in the next month. She says that she will not go on vacation. She also has no vacation in 1 1/2 months. She feels that she can still go even with the I mean after the surgery. She wants to go as soon as possible. She sees that the best course of action is gon na be for surgery, and she will be able to go home okay

Pardon what

TYPE OF THE patient's symptoms are: Bony crepitus, swelling ecchymosis, bruising tenderness throughout, evidence of potential fracture, and evidence of a colles' fracture. I see that the joints between her wrist are present to a variable degree if dorsal angulation is severe presenting with a dinner fork deformity ulnar styloid fracture is present, and there is evidence of possibility of a a fracture. She reports that her wrist is not able to move any direction of this hand for some reasons, and that's going to be wearing a brace for 6 weeks in the following weeks. I recommend that she also go to Physical Therapy to determine how much she can do 3 times a week just to make sure she can get her wrist as strong as possible to prevent like future injury now the cool thing about getting any kind of a bone break is that her your body comes out even stronger so this shouldn't happen again but unfortunately like it's these deform these deformities that really that really kind of hurt is the short version.

Patient reports that he likes to go outside and and he does spend a lot of time out in the yard. He does not get out of the woods very often. He usually watches his sugar intake. I usually watch it the form of high what i'm eating but

Possible lyme disease. I think that we got this early enough that we can just treat him with some oral antibiotics. I would like to avoid intravenous antibiotics which i think we can avoid but i wanted to see how he does with this. I wanted to order a lipid panel just to make sure that everything is okay with his cholesterol. He seems to be you know one twenty

Mr. Morales states she probably has an ankle sprain. I advised her to avoid weightbearing until she receives a fracture. If her x- ray shows a fracture, we are going to put her in a splint and give her crutches. She will follow up with us at orthopedics. At that point, she can try partial weightbearing or anti-inflammatories. We discussed the possibility of needing surgery and if she does not recover quickly, we can consider casting a wider net to see if she has any additional injuries.

He has been wearing the same shoes for 2 to 3 weeks. He denies any other symptoms such as fever, chills, drainage from the wound or anything along those lines. The patient states he bought a new pair of shoes to travel with and the neuropathy is present. He states he did not feel that the shoes were too tight at first but they moved and he was unable to get another one. He notes that the wound is proximal to the right 5th MTP joint. There is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue. No surrounding erythema or cellulitis. No evidence of fluid collection. No necrosis. No odor.

No osteomyelitis or bone infection noted. At this time, I have recommended that we order an ankle brachial index abi to determine the blood supply to the foot. We will also perform a debridement here in the office to take off some of the dead tissue. Next I am going to prescribe a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound once daily and then cover with a dry sterile dressing. Until we see the wound shrinking, I want the patient to wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off of the area. No more antibiotics are needed at this time and I want to see him again in 2 weeks as the patient may need to refer to a vascular specialist if the abi indicates his blood supply is not optimal for wound healing.

No tenderness present at the sternoclavicular or ACRACLIC joints. Hand grip is normal. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. No numbness present in the right arm.
Examination of the left shoulder: No fracture.
RESULTS

X-ray images of the bilateral upper extremities were obtained and review in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture. There is no significant pain with movement or strength testing however, I want to refer the patient to formal physical therapy for approximately 6 to 8 weeks. During that time, he should continue taking Tylenol as needed for pain. If his symptoms do not improve, we can consider a steroid injection to the shoulder which could provide some relief

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Left shoulder pain, likely rotator cuff tendinopathy.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient reports symptoms similar to left shoulder pain that are consistent with right shoulder rotatorcation. Given that he has had some previous right shoulder problems, I believe we should order an MRI since he has been experiencing these symptoms for the past few weeks, and since his x-ray from last week showed no signs of a fracture, we will proceed with a MRI of the entire right shoulder to evaluate for possible left shoulder injury.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: Neck is supple trachea is midline. No thyromegaly, lymphadenopathy, or immunosuppressant pulmonary function tests

RESULTS

Pulmonary function test performed today demonstrates decreased lung sounds bilaterally. Brisk capillary refill is also consistent with moderate-intermittent asthma

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Moderate-intermediate asthma.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient’s symptoms are inconsistent with moderate to intermediate asthma. Her subsequent pulmonary function testing and exam today demonstrated diminished lung sounds consistent with asthma. - Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed the importance of consistent use of the inhaled steroid inhaler. We also discussed that it is important for the patient to be consistent with his inhaler as prescribed. We discussed treatment options and that I want him to continue using his ventolin inher. I advised him to wait and see how his breathing is before increasing his dose of prednisone. He will take less and less over the next 9 to 10 days. I’m also going to put together an asthma action plan for him based on his symptoms. I would like to see him again in a month or sooner if he has any worsening symptoms

2. Prevalent flovent 1,100 mg, 1 puff twice per day. This will help prevent daily symptoms and will help reduce their severity. He should continue to use his asthma rescue inhaler frequently. We will work on how to handle any symptoms that may be associated with his use of this. I will see him in 30 days.

ASSESSMENT

Left upper lobe incidentally found.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient's exam today revealed a solitary 2 cm left upper lobe nodle. Given his smoking history and recent exam with pulmonary function testing, I believe it is best to remove this along with a portion of his lung. We will proceed to plan the removal of the lung during or via video assisted thoracoscopy. He will be admitted to the hospital, and will have a chest tube placed the following day. At bedside most likely will be unable to breathe. I will also recommend that we start formal medication therapy as has been previously outlined for him.

Lateral malleolar fracture, right ankle

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained that his x-rays revealed a displaced lateral malleolus at the Weber C level. There is no evidence of medial or posterior malleyolar fractures. This is a fracture on the anterior side of his ankle and it is unstable. We discussed that since it is in the location that it is, he is probably going to need surgery, which includes putting some plate and screws in. He will be out for approximately 3 months, but we are hopeful that within that time he can resume basketball coaching. We will get him crutches and hopefully he can get back out doing some exercise again.

Right face stabbing shooting pain.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient is a 54-year-old male who presents for evaluation of facial pain. He reports that he has had intermittent right face stabbing pain for approximately 2 to 3 months. He first noticed the pain after taking some Tylenol, which did not provide immediate relief. He has since tried applying tiger balm, which has not been beneficial, and utilizes gabapentin and Tegretol. The patient states that he occasionally has headaches, but denies any history of migraines. He describes the pain as being especially severe and describes it as being like somebody is stabbing him with an ice pick. When the pain starts, he usually resolves after a few minutes and after taking medication, the pain usually resolves. He states that the pain lasts for approximately an hour. He denies any specific sensory loss, numbness, or tingling in his face, however, he has experienced spikes in pain with certain stimuli, such as extreme weather, cold, or certain types of medication. He endorses pain with extreme pain, stating “it can last for an hour”, and adds that surgical options are always on the table. Initially, the patient was seen as having a history of multiple sclerosis, but his family doctor advised that his pain is more localized to the right side of his face and that he does not have any symptoms that are specific to this area. When assessing the patient, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms, including possible trigeminal neuralgia. I discussed the nature of the diagnosis and treatment options with him. I have recommended that we begin with the conservative treatment plan of Tegretol, and the patient will follow up with me in 1 month to check on his progress. If his pain does not improve with the TEGRETol, we will discuss surgical options including decompress the nerve. (end medical discussion)

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture and that his pain is likely caused by multiple factors including internal bleeding and the presence of fentanyl. We discussed treatment options for his current pain and I have recommended that we begin with a robaxin 1500 mg once a day to treat his pain. He will also be provided with an MRI of the heart and soft tissues to obtain a more complete picture of his chest and abdomen. I advised the patient that I want to treat this conservatively. I want him to discontinue the use of fentanyl asap, however, he may want to continue using other NSAIDs if his pain continues to worsen.
