1. Bilateral reduction mammoplasty.
Bilateral breast reduction.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient is a great candidate for the surgery and all indicated procedures. She will follow up in 3 hours after surgery. We will review her breast density and discuss the risks, benefits, and alternatives at that time. At this time, we will discuss the risk, including postoperative depression, nausea, and morbidity, with the patient. I advised her to be conservative with her physical activity restrictions for the next 6 weeks prior to the surgery. Additionally, we discussed the difficulty of obtaining the required insurance coverage and what effects that can have on her recovery. She should avoid smoking or alcohol while at the site of the operation. We also discussed the risks associated with breast reduction surgery including nipple retraction and discharge bilaterally. No breast tenderness, masses, or axillary lymphadenopathy is palpable.
 - Medical Treatment: We will start her on Propranolol as needed for pain, and then we will work with her on a surgery date. Prescription for Imodium is provided as well for pain relief.
Patient Agreements: She will be placed with a breast reduction provider who will approve the plan and will contact the patient with a referral. Pres

I have recommended that he stop tennis as much as he can and I have also advised him to avoid repetitive stress in his right arm. I want him to stop tennis for the next 4 to 6 weeks.
Regarding his diabetes, this appears to be due to overuse likely due to the increase in his tennis activity.

The patient was advised that he is doing well on metformin 500 mg twice daily and that the patient should avoid repetitive stress in his right arm. I advised him that ice will not be helpful for pain and that he will need to take Flovent twice a day as needed. Prescription for Ultram 50 mg once a day should help with his elbow pain.
