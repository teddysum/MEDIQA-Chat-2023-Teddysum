We discussed topical therapy and using an Elf facial cleanser and noncomedogenic moisturizer. She endorses using water and a washcloth in the morning, and if she feels greasy in the evening, she will use a moisturizer with sunscreen SPF 30 or higher. This means it will clog her pores. She will start using this a few nights a week and slowly work up to using it every night. If it is not covered by insurance, she can try different gel over the counter.
 She also has multiple benign moles on her arms, legs, and back. The chest and back are relatively spared. I want to highlight the multiple benign nevi on the trunk and extremities. She scattered skin colored papules over the face, primarily on the forehead and with some on the central cheeks and chin. Normal exam is performed today.

Depending on the severity of her aortic stenosis, we may need to consider an ischemic evaluation or further, possibly a heart mon- monitor to assess overall burden of the PVCS. At this point, she is asymptomatic, so we will start with the echocyardiogram only. Her primary care physician treated her with meclizine today. Due to bilateral leg pain over the last month, she has considered undergoing a chest x-ray and is now going to have one scheduled for evaluation. She is taking all the medicines that were prescribed for her with the exception of her lisinopril. I recommended that the patient discontinue the use of her statin due to her leg pain. She will follow up with me in 3 or 4 weeks to discuss results and next steps.

Low back pain.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient was last seen in the office yesterday while raking leaves. He felt fine when he got home but then his back started tightening up and he started getting pins in his right foot. He has had low back pain before but it went away after a day. He did not take any ice and tried 2 advils which did not help. He estimates that his pain is more severe when he stands up. His partner reports that he has pain when he is standing up. They always come in together and have experienced pain together many times in the past few weeks. The patient states that it hurts more when he bends over. He denies any prior pain withstanding family members calling him and he notes that family members have also caused him pain. He is worried about his pain tolerance because his pain level is so high. He wouldn't be saying anything if it was not a problem. This is more of a long term injury. He reports that his wife makes him do all the yard work. They have a long history of being physical and this is their first time experiencing back pain; however, they had surgery yesterday and she was fine. Given that it has been raining leaves today, they have been doing a lot of yard work, which is normally not their primary activity, they were concerned.

His diabetes is well controlled but his last Hgb A1c was 8. He states that he does not think his diabetes is bad but he does think it is important to get his diabetes under control in order to get the wound to heal. A collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound once daily and then cover with a dry sterile dressing. He will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and a nice pink tissue is present. He wants to wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off of the area. I do not think any more antibiotics are needed at this time and I want to see him again in 2 weeks.

Given that her recent antibody test was positive, I believe this is a viral infection that affects the liver. She will undergo an additional blood work to confirm the diagnosis. We will also refer her to our primary care physician for further evaluation and treatment.

The patient was seen by his primary care physician for a cough which initially was diagnosed as bronchitis, but after 3 months the patient was sent to see the PPC for further evaluation and he was told that he did not have pneumonia. He then underwent a chest CT scan which revealed a 2 cm nodule in the lateral aspect of the right lower lobe. The nodule was smooth in appearance and no evidence of emphysematous disease was present. He was then referred to me for evaluation and management as follows:

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Patient reports history of rheumatoid arthritis. He currently takes methotrexate 7.2 mg every week. As long as he is keeping active his joints feel okay, and if he has any problems it is mostly with his hands. He has not had any recent flares.

FAMILY HENCE

Mother, deceased age 60, from complications of breast cancer. Denies any family history of lung cancer or other type of malignancies

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports bilateral pulmonary edema.
Skin: Plight pink to light touch.
Neurological: Denies chest pain or dyspnea on exertion

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Regular rate and rhythm. No clicks, rubs, or murmurs.
RESPIRATORY: Capillary refill is brisk.
NEURO: Normal respiratory effort.
MSK: Examination of the bilateral upper extremities: No edema to the lower extremities. It looks like you have a little swelling to to your knuckles there on the 3rd digit on each hand. However pulses are intact in all extremities and capillary refill are brisk

RESULTS

Cardiovascular: Blood pressure: 128/72 mmHg
Respiratory rate: 16 bpm
Oxygen saturation: 98%.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient had a Chest CT prior to his arrival today. The results of that CT do reveal a solitary 2 mm nodule on the medial aspect of his right upper lobes. I reviewed the patient's pulmonary function test today and his pulmonary function is normal. I have also ordered a PFT to establish a baseline for his lung function. We will also schedule a PET Ct to determine if the nodule is metabolically active. Given his smoking history and recent flare, I am going to go ahead and suggest that we do remove this during or via video assisted thoracoscopy. I will go in with a camera and scope and we will remove that along with a very small portion of his lung. He will be under general anesthesia and it will take approximately an hour and a half to perform the procedure. After the procedure, he will be admitted and will have a chest tube in until the following day. I advised him that he will most likely be in the hospital for 1 night and will go home the next day.

He notes that his ankle does not feel particularly stable. He denies being able to stand on it and he feels that he will injure it more just because it does not have a solid base. He states that he is a big step Kurry fan. He likes to keep up shots from from way out past the three point line. He is only 10 and tiny. The dog walker that works from home helps with the walking. I am happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of buddies playing to lead him. I have volunteered to coach starting in 04/2021.

RESULTS

X-ray of the right knee was obtained and reviewed today. It does not reveal any bony abnormalities. However, I am concerned that she has ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament, a major ligament that helps connect and helps her knee move back and forth. We will obtain a knee MRI to confirm the physical exam. If this confirms local pain, we will proceed with placing her in a brace to help her knee feel more supported. I am hoping that we can get this MRI done in the next couple of days, so that I can discuss what needs to be done Now she is a very active active mom and denies any other exercise or anything else that that I should be aware of. Questions: Which kind of graft would be needed for the acl?

ASSESSMENT

1. Right knee injury

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that she sustained a right knee ruptured. We discussed the risks, benefits, and alternatives of grafting."

Motor vehicle crashes.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Brandon Taylor is a pleasant 53-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of neck pain. The patient has a history of several car crashes in the past few months. He was fine after his second crash although he was in therapy for a few months and after his third crash he had surgery. He is currently experiencing pain that can be explained by multiple things. His most recent crash was in 02/2021 when he was coming home from a pain clinic because he felt his neck hurt and back hurt. He denies any hematochezia. Unfortunately, the patient has been prescribed fentanyl 15 mg daily for pain and has not filled a prescription for several weeks. He states that he has been avoiding medication that would help with his pain. Currently, he is utilizing Robaxin 15 mg 6-8 hours every 6 to 8 hours. If his pain does not improve, he will discontinue the use of fentanyl and we will refer him to pain management if it becomes complicated. 

The patient denies any fatigue. He reports that his lawyer told him to report to the lawyer due to his neck hurting. I understand that the patient is being provided with the best medical treatment possible. I want to make sure that he is getting the best advise possible. In order to do that, I want him to do his best to roll through these exercises every morning. I have also advised him to put ice on his neck whenever he is experiencing pain. Questions:
1. Overview of Neck Pain
2. Medical Reasoning: The patient reports pain that is 10 out of 10. His pain level is rated on a scale of 1 to 10, which is, of course, severe.
3. Pain with Movement: Moderate range of movement.
Pain with Strength: Intact to palpation both on the bony process and the muscle. Can he move his neck from side to side?

Psychiatric: Reports headaches, dizziness, and visual disturbances. Denies him pain with any medication. Professionally, I counseled the patient on the importance of obtaining a CT of the heart and soft tissues. If at the end of the current visit his pain has not improved, we will upgrade to an MRI to obtain a better image of his brain, heart, and sensory tract.
                The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.
